;; Package-Requires: ((request) (json "1.4"))
;; Keywords: convenience url-shortener

;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements convenient functions to shorten an url with
;; Yourls API, Your Own URL Shortener.
;;
;; It provides two commands to shorten, `yourls-at-point' and
;; `yourls-region'.
;;
;; To used it you have to define two variables, `yourls-api-endpoint'
;; and `yourls-api-signature'.  Your can learn them at
;; http://yourls.org/#API.
